The "Cluck & Cut" Cookout

Forget the canteen slop—we’re taking over the kitchen! It’s a DIY dinner night where we turn raw chicken into a legendary spicy curry, completely from scratch. Bring your chopping skills as we marinate, sauté, and taste-test our way to perfection. It’s going to be messy, chaotic, and smell amazing. Once the food is piping hot, we’re crashing on the beanbags for an all-night movie marathon. Good food, questionable cooking skills, and great cinema. Come hungry!
